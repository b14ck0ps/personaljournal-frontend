### Introduction to Personal Journal Next.js Application
The Personal Journal Next.js Application is a front-end application built on top of the Personal Journal API. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with their personal journal entries, tags, and comments. The application is built using Next.js 13, a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications.

The Personal Journal Next.js Application provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to perform CRUD operations on their journal entries, tags, and comments. The application uses server-side rendering to provide fast loading times and a seamless user experience. It also includes features such as authentication and authorization to ensure the security of user data.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
